WELCOME TO BAMAZON

Bamazon is a shopping experience for the Geek Gamers/Cosplayers out there. Dice, weapons and magic potion ingredients are available and ready to ship!

Bamazon utilizes MySQL to house the database and the user interface is through the Command Line Interface (CLI) only. Customers will order products they want from a list. Bamazon will tally total transactions for the customer, as well as update inventories immediately.

Programmer notes: The creation of this app was made possible through two previous class activities:

iceCreamDBConnection.js (week 12-6) was used as a template to create a link to the MySQL database and the main.js file through our port.

greatBayBasic.js (week 12-10) was used as a template for inquiries, and reading/updating to the database. This activity also introduced  the 'console.table' module to make data displayed in the terminal window to be more aesthetically pleasing.

Here is a short demo to watch the app in action.
